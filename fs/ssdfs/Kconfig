	  Zlib is designed to be a free, general-purpose, legally unencumbered,

	  hardware and operating system. It offers a good trade-off between
	  compression achieved and the amount of CPU time and memory necessary

config SSDFS_SAVE_WHOLE_BLK2OFF_TBL_IN_EVERY_LOG
	bool "Save whole offset translation table in every log"
	depends on SSDFS
	default y
	help
	  This option enables the technique of storing the whole
	  offset translation table in every log. SSDFS can distribute
	  the complete state of ofset translation table among multiple
	  logs. It could decrease amount of metadata in the log.
	  However, this policy increases the amount of read I/O requests
	  because it requires to read multiple log headers in the same
	  erase block. If a big erase block contains a lot of small
	  partial logs then it can degrades file system performance
	  because of significant amount of read I/O during
	  initialization phase.

config SSDFS_CHECK_LOGICAL_BLOCK_EMPTYNESS
	bool "SSDFS check a logical block emptyness on every write"
	depends on SSDFS
	help
	  This option enables the technique of checking a logical block
	  emptyness on every write. The goal of this technique is
	  to prevent the re-writing pages with existing data because
	  SSD's FTL can manage this sutiation. However, this can be the
	  source of data and metadata corruption in the case of some
	  issues in file system driver logic. But it needs to take into
	  account that this technique could degrade the write performance
	  of file system driver. Also, file system volume has to be erased
	  during creation by mkfs. Otherwise, file system driver will fail
	  to write even for the case correct write operations.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SSDFS_ONLINE_FSCK

	  This option enables the online FSCK functionality. Every erase

	  after some number of log commit operations. The responsibility of
	  this thread is to check checksums and correctness of metadata
	  structures. If any corruptions have been detected, then the thread
	  will report about it and it will try to recover the corruption(s)
	  in the background.

	  by means of incrementing a global counters and deallocation
	  (kfree, kmem_cache_free, free_page) by means decrementing
	  the same global counters. Also, there are special global counters
	  that tracking the number of locked/unlocked memory pages.
	  However, global counters have an unpleasant side effect.
	  If there are several mounted SSDFS partitions in the system
	  then memory leaks accounting subsystem is miscalculating
	  the number of memory leaks and triggers false alarms.
	  It makes sense to use the memory leaks accounting subsystem
	  only for single mounted SSDFS partition in the system.
